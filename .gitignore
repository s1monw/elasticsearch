## eclipse ignores (use 'mvn eclipse:eclipse' to build eclipse projects)
## The only configuration files which are not ignored are .settings since
## these files ensure common coding style across Eclipse and IDEA
## Other files (.project, .classpath) should be generated through Maven which
## will correctly set the classpath based on the declared dependencies.
